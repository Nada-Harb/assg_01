    <h3><b>Re:Eileen Dover university application</b></h3>
    <h5>Dear Eileen,</h5>

    <p>Thank you for recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science
        faculty to study as part <br> of your <abbr title="Philosophiae Doctor">PhD</abbr>next year.I will answer your questions one by one,
        in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        <br>could start
        at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul >
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iugaza.edu.ps/"> important university dates </a>
         on our website</p>

    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Facuity, we have a pretty open-inded research facuity __ as long as the subjects fall<br>
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated research, and just <br>
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
    by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at teperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the <br>
        oudience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So Please canyou provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you&apos;d expect the <br>
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we&apos;d need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <h5>Polynesian chicken dance</h5>
    <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;">A little known but <i>very</i> influential dace back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>
        , a whole village would dance around <br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be &quot; fruitful &quot; </p>

    <h5>Icelandic brownian shuffle</h5>
    <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;">Befor the Icelandic developed fire as a means of gitting warm, they used to practice this dancec, which <br>
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
    tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow studants used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
    modern styles such as Twerking.</p>

    <h5>Arctic robot dance</h5>
    <p style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub> belived to have <br>
    discovered a new dance style characterised by &quot;robotic &quot;, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
    because they were really cold.</p>
